# Horiseon Refactoring for Accessibility

## Purpose

 Improve website accessibility to increase site traffic and search engine optimization, in addition to enhancing the organization of the HTML and CSS for ease of use in future updates.


 ### Overview of Updates Made

 * Editted the title of the webpage/current tab to reflect the name of the company

 * Added an "id" to the "Search Engine Optimization" division in the HTML so the webpage will properly navigate when clicking on navigation listing at the top of the page.

 * Added "alts" to the images in the "content" section so that alternative texts can appear when necessary.

 * Changed the HTML block containing the navigations from a "div" to a "nav" for better readability. In the same vain, updated the footer to a "footer" element rather than "div" element.

 * Housed the div's in the "content" and "benefits" section within "articles" for better readability.

 * Increased spacing in HTML for increased readability.

 * Added variables for the different colors used and replaced the hex codes within the CSS to those variables.

 * Reorganized the CSS layout to follow the same order as the HTML.

 * Consolidated rules for the "content" and "benefits" sections which were unnecessarily split into several different rules.
